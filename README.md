Description
This College Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a college or educational institution. The system is built using Java programming language and utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), SQL for database management, and is developed using IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE).

The system allows administrative staff and faculty to manage student records, course information, faculty details, and other academic-related data in an efficient and user-friendly manner. It integrates data handling capabilities with a responsive desktop application, offering a seamless experience for managing and accessing vital academic information.

Faculty Management: Manage faculty details, assign them to courses, and track their performance.

Database Integration: The application uses a SQL database to store all the information securely. (Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any JDBC-compatible database).

GUI with Swing: User-friendly and intuitive interface built using Java Swing for seamless interaction.

Login Authentication: Secure login for administrators, faculty, and students with role-based access controls.

Technologies Used:
Java: Core programming language for building the application logic.
Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
SQL: For database management (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
JDBC: For connecting Java with the database.
IntelliJ IDEA: The IDE used for development.
Maven/Gradle: Build automation tools (optional depending on your project setup).
